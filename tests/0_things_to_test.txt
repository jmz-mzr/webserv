To compare with NGINX:
	- Invalid IP and/or port
	- No server defined in the config file
	- Directives defined after a location (should still be
	  inherited by the location)

Request parsing:
	- Invalid Request Line
	- Invalid or missing Host Header
	  (see RFC,
	  https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/7278,
	  https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=62739)
	- Invalid existing Header (like "Content-Length: fsd")
